Welcome to the AWS Attack Simulation Framework! This toolkit is designed for security researchers, penetration testers, and red teamers to simulate various attack scenarios in AWS environments. The end goal is to provide a comprehensive set of tools to help you identify and mitigate security weaknesses in your AWS infrastructure.

## Features
### Privilege Escalation Scenarios
#### User IAM Modification: Exploit weak configurations to escalate privileges by modifying IAM user policies.
#### IAM Policy Modification: Simulate privilege escalation by adding additional permissions to existing IAM policies.
#### Instance Metadata Service Abuse
#### Metadata Abuse: Retrieve IAM role credentials by exploiting the EC2 instance metadata service.

### Network and Resource Manipulation
#### DNS Hijacking: Simulate DNS hijacking attacks to redirect traffic and intercept sensitive information.
#### VPC Network Manipulation: Modify VPC configurations, including route tables and security groups, to allow unauthorized access.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
#### AWS Account: An AWS account with appropriate permissions for testing.
#### AWS CLI: Configure the AWS CLI with necessary credentials.
#### Python 3.x: Ensure Python and required libraries are installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and cd into it:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-attack-simulation-framework.git`
`cd aws-attack-simulation-framework`

2. Install the required Python libraries:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage

Each attack script is designed to simulate a specific scenario. Detailed usage instructions are provided within each script.

Example: Running the Metadata Abuse Script

`python metadata_service_abuse.py`

## Important Considerations

1. Ethical Use: Use these tools responsibly and only in environments where you have explicit authorization. Unauthorized use can lead to legal consequences.
2. Testing Environment: Always conduct tests in a safe, controlled, and isolated environment.
3. Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve the framework.
